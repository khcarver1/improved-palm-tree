Download WINSCP here. You'll find the "klipper.bin" file in the home>pi>out folder. For the SKR board you have, rename this to firmware.bin, put this on a clean SD card, and flash it to your printer. You'll put this card in your printer-powered off, make sure the pi is unplugged from your printer, and allow it 5 minutes to sit after turning on. Then you can plug your pi in.
